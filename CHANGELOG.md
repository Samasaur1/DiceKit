## [0.17.0] - 2019-07-26
### Added
- New feature guidelines
- Issue and pull request templates
- `Rollable`
  - `chance(of:_:)`
  - `probabilities` — property of type `Chances`
  - `chance(of:)` for rolling in ranges
- `CustomDie`
  - `chance(of:)` for a specific possibility
- `Chance`
  - `gcd(_:_:)` and `lcm(_:_:)`

### Fixed
- Latest compatible version links to refer to releases rather than the tree at the specified tag
- `Rollable`
