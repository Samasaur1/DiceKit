If you are merging to a non-`master` branch, I assume you know what you are doing. Most PRs should be made to `master`.

If you are merging to `master`, you have two options: explicitly say that these changes constitute a "new version" (you probably don't want to do that, and I will walk you through it if that is what you should be doing), or just merge your changes in to `master` and they will be released when I determine it is time for a new version.

Assuming you are not merging as a new version:
1. Fill in the list below with your changes, referring to issues when appropriate (https://docs.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords).
1. Fill in any information you want to share, if you have any. Otherwise, remove that line.
1. Change the task list below to contain any tasks you need to complete before this PR can be merged.
1. You can now delete these instructions, so that "Here's what's new" is the first line of your PR body.

Here's what's new:
- A
- List
- Of
- Items

Any other information you want to share here
